# Statuslog

An intuitive and hassle-free solution for teams to monitor the status of their headless websites hosted on Vercel. This eliminates the need for team members to have GitHub/SSO/Vercel accounts or log in to Vercel separately - it provides a user-friendly interface that keeps account and project managers informed about their clients' website status, ensuring client satisfaction and peace of mind.

## Installation

1.  Copy ".env.sample" and provide the following three variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_TOKEN,` `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_TEAM_ID,` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY`
2.  Run `npm run dev` to test / update.

## Note(s) (for organization)
